# Chess Game

This project consists of a simple Chess game to play 1 vs 1 on the same computer. It was made with C++ and SFML.

## Info

The game handles all the rules of chess, checking if it is a legal move, if the king is in check, the king can't make a suicide move, and even if there are no other possible moves, the game ends.
 
> The only thing that is not yet implemented is the pawn transformation when reaching the other side of the board.

**Note:** The executable is not yet implemented to run, it only runs inside Visual Studio.

## Future implementations

- Add an in-game AI, with the possibility to play versus the machine or another person.

- Implement pawn transformation.

- Optimize code.
